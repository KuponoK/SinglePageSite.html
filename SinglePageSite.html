					<h2>The Best Video Game</h2>
					<p>The best video game of all time has to go to "The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time". If you are unaware of this game you must be a young. Everyone knew about this game when it came out. But why? What was so different with this game than any other game that was out at that time? This game is easily at the top because it brought so many new features that are used in games even now! With the open world features, the different tools and weapons you obtain throughout the story, and how the story revolves around this massive, for it's time, open world. This runs the for top spot for the best game of all time for its ranking at #1, and score of 99 on the Metacritic rankings. For reference, Skyrim, amazing game in my opinion, was ranked at #40, with a score of 96.</p>

					<h2>Soundtracks</h2>
					<p>Top soundtrack spot goes to Ico. The way the music brought you in and made you feel weak and powerless. This game came out for the PS2 in 2001 and was about two kids, Ico and Yorda, both that were supposed to end up being child-sacrifices, wandering endless ancient ruins. The music captures you and depending on the situation of the game, the music would change. Like in a horror movie, the terrifying beat leading up to bad guy with a jump-scare. The music was beautiful and flowed really good with the game, giving it the top spot at #1.</p>

						<h2>The Best Character</h2>
						<p>Do I even have to say his name? The best video game character ever, Mario. Easily the most recognized and loved character. The man behind the legendary series that brought us amazing classics like Super Mario 64, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Super Mario Brothers Wii. Straight Classics and thousands of memories playing through those great games. The easy to follow and understand game that can have the whole family playing. </p>
